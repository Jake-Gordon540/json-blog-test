# json-blog-test
This is a test project I created to learn how to use json with javascript <br/>

To run this program I use visual studio code. I have installed live server to test the html.

1st you will need to spin up a server for the json. I create a terminal and enter json-server --watch data/db.json into the terminal. 
(this code snippet can also be found as a comment in the index.js file)

Next I right click the index.html file and select run live server. 

This project should work after that.
